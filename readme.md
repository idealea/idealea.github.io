# Better Enterprise Architecture

### By Mark Anthony Healy

Abstract

_IdealEA is a new approach to Enterprise Architecture focusing on ease of implementation and maximum relevance and longevity of Architecture artefacts. By focusing on their Ideal Architecture, an organisation can quickly assess any proposed change on the basis of whether or not it moves the organisation towards the Ideal. For brevity, the scope of this article has been largely restricted to Business Process Modelling within the Ideal Enterprise Architecture._

## INTRODUCTION

This paper outlines a new approach to Enterprise Architecture, largely ignoring transitions from baseline to target architectures and instead focusing on the Ideal Architecture, allowing an organization to quickly assess any proposed change on the basis of whether or not it moves the organization towards the Ideal Architecture.

Synopsis of the norm

Some excellent work outlining the key differences between established EA Frameworks exists in the public domain (Sessions, 2007), very briefly, we have the taxonomy focused Zachman Framework, the methodology forming TOGAF Framework, the US Federal Government FEA and the experience based Gartner practice. Despite their differing foci, each approach will invariably begin with an examination of the current environment, or baseline architecture, before mapping out the target architecture with potentially one or more interim architectures.

## Shortcomings of the norm

Succinctly, today&#39;s Target is tomorrow&#39;s Baseline – the reward for change becomes the impetus for change. Irrespective of the frameworks and methodologies used, traditional approaches to EA will result in a constrained, sub-optimum target architecture. By beginning the process with an examination of the current environment, organizational &quot;baggage&quot; from each domain is accepted as standard procedure and carried forward through to the target architecture. In addition, the target architecture is bounded by what is deemed reasonable or achievable within defined timeframes and finite resourcing.

Organizations do not exist in isolation; rather they are part of an ever-changing ecosystem imposing a need for constant change. Long term EA planning results in an architecture at odds with its surroundings as it is firmly based on the organizational structure and requirements at a point in time. Instead, timely, decisive reaction to change is needed in order to achieve optimum success. This decisive reaction needs to be validated and proven to be in sync with the goals of the organization – traditional EA Frameworks and methodologies do not support this.

## Introduction to the Ideal Architecture

The Ideal Architecture is just that - an unconstrained and aspirational architecture. Its purpose is to define the ultimate potential end-point for the enterprise. Once defined it should remain unchanged for the lifetime of the Enterprise (saving major restructuring or revised organizational focus).

The Ideal Architecture transcends technical feasibility or even possibility and is devoid of any technical components. For example, rather than defining tasks such as &quot;notify customer via email&quot; we simply &quot;notify customer&quot;.  At any point in time a notification method is chosen based on its convenience, efficacy, efficiency and availability.

The Ideal Architecture applies the same principles across all processes and domains and is not bounded by available resources, budgetary considerations etc. As an aspirational architecture, it is something an organization strives to approach but never expects to achieve.

Furthermore, the focus is on ideal inputs and outputs. All inputs are assumed to be accurate and complete and will pass through standard processes resulting in &quot;as expected&quot; outputs.

Processing of exceptions, errors and alternatives is retrofit into the Ideal Architecture once completed. In any well engineered process, there should be an expectation that the majority of inputs to be correct and subject to standard processing, otherwise, the integrity and definition of the process should be questioned.

At the highest level of granularity, any ideal process should be describable in just 3 entities:

- .Input – our accurate and complete input (e.g. Application for Journal Subscription)
- .Process – our standard process, succinctly described (e.g. Create Journal Subscription)
- .Output - our &quot;as-expected&quot; output; in this case, an Activated Subscription.

Exceptions (e.g. payment failures), errors (e.g. incomplete application) and alternatives (e.g. online only access) are out of scope in this phase of the Ideal Architecture. Once the Ideal Architecture has been completed; the Derived Artefacts are used to address Exceptions, Errors and Alternatives.

## The Derived Artefacts

The Derived Artefacts bear no resemblance to Target Artefacts; rather, they are used to protect the Ideal architecture from imperfect inputs and digressions, encompassing Exceptions, Errors and Alternatives.

### Exceptions

In our Ideal Architecture, Exceptions are identified and managed as early as possible. A &quot;Quality&quot; process precedes our Ideal process, managing exceptions and removing them before we enter the Ideal Process.

### Errors

As with Exceptions, Errors are handled by the &quot;Quality&quot; pre-process. Unlike Exceptions; in addition to being handled, Errors are tracked and eliminated through an iterative process.

### Alternatives

In contrast to Exceptions and Errors, Alternatives are dealt with as late as possible in the process; this ensures that the standard process is reused to the greatest extent possible. Again, unlike Exceptions and Errors, we do not necessarily seek to limit the range of alternatives; instead, the focus is on minimizing their impact on the standard process.

### The Quality Pre-process

The Quality process serves two distinct purposes as outlined above; it is used to a) prevent errors and exceptions from entering our Ideal process while being equally focused on b) the iterative elimination of errors by tracking their occurrence and through the continuous refinement of the Quality Pre-process.

As a precursor to the Ideal Process, the Quality Pre-process can be continually revised independently of the core process in order to eliminate as many errors and exceptions as possible.

## Implementation

IdealEA is not implemented on foot of a need for large-scale change within the Organisation; instead its purpose is to ensure that any organisational change being considered is in line with the Ideal Enterprise Architecture. The scale and scope of the proposed change is irrelevant – if the change does not lead the organization closer to the Ideal, it should not be implemented.

## Phase 1 - Definition

### Existence

The initial step is Existence, where the high level &quot;raison d&#39;être&quot; of the Organisation is identified and extrapolated.

#### Ignore the Nuances

Unlike traditional EA programmes where Subject Matter Experts and key stakeholders are engaged with at length in order to define the Baseline Architecture and agree Target Architecture(s), Existence requires minimal knowledge of the particular structures, processes and systems within an Organization. A high level synopsis of the Organization is enough to complete Existence, resulting in a generic definition of how the Organization could operate.

The lack of stakeholder and SME input in the initial phase of implementation ensures that peculiarities within existing processes do not influence the Ideal Architecture. In addition, disruption to normal operations are minimised as key resources are not diverting their attention to helping define the Baseline Architecture.

#### Strive for Simplicity

Initial artefacts should be restricted to high-level overviews of the Ideal Architecture and should be used to define what the organisation does, not how it is done.

#### Ignorance is Bliss

Across all domains, subject matter expertise should be avoided, particularly in relation to technical components. While defining the IdealEA, expertise can create restriction and dampen ambition; our purpose here is to define an aspirational, unachievable architectural vision for the organisation – the feasibility and validity of that Ideal is not in scope.

#### Validate

Upon completion of &quot;Existence&quot; key stakeholders are engaged with in order to ensure the accuracy of the Existence artefacts. It is imperative that these stakeholders are aware of the high-level, idealised perspective and that constraints or extraneous requirements are out of scope.

### Mission

Once Existence has been signed off by the various Business Owners work begins on &quot;Mission&quot;. The aim here is to extrapolate the mission statement of the organization in order to define broad, high level goals and motivations for the organisation. These high level business drivers will later help to shape the Ideal Architecture.

#### Proceed With Caution

It would be easy to take generic goals of the organisation and use these as &quot;Mission&quot;; often these generic goals will be repeated across domains, organisations and even industries (&quot;Exceptional Customer Service&quot;, &quot;Cost Efficient Service&quot; etc. etc.). Rather than helping to shape the Ideal Architecture, goals such as these hinder the process as they result in a generic, unfocused vision. Instead, the aim of Mission is two-fold:

- -.Identify the Unique Selling Point (USP) of the Organisation
- -.Establish Prioritized Organizational Goals (POG)

#### Validate

Mission is designed to ensure that the Ideal Architecture a) Preserves and enhances the organisation&#39;s USP and b) is tailored to support our Prioritized Organisational Goals. As a result, Mission can be somewhat difficult, and indeed arduous, to complete as Business Owners may have differing views on prioritisation of goals.

## Phase 2 – Abstraction

### Integration

At this point, a consensus of what the organisation does and why it does it should be agreed. Focus now changes to integrating the various functions within the organisation in order to eliminate redundant processing and streamline processes. Given that this is an ideal implementation of the organisation, the aim here is that any task is only ever performed once, and where possible is completely automated. Whether functional integration is made possible via a single, monolithic solution or heterogeneous targeted solutions with multiple integration points is unimportant as long as maximum integration is achieved.

#### Entities

Any input to a process is abstracted into a larger Entity. This abstraction allows looking beyond an individual input (e.g. a magazine/journal subscription renewal) into a larger, more diverse Entity responsible for the input. In this way, the same Entity (in this example, a Person) can be shared among a multitude of processes across all domains. Person A can initially engage as a subscriber (with a &quot;Subscription&quot; input), later a contributor (with an &quot;Article&quot; input), a potential employee (with a &quot;Job Application&quot; input), a new hire (with an &quot;On-boarding&quot; input) and finally an employee engaged with numerous processes and inputs. This abstraction allows for maximum reuse of data across domains and processes while also offering a greater insight into the interactions with internal and external stakeholders.

#### Transformation

Output transformation allows entities to seamlessly move between processes (e.g. a &quot;candidate&quot; input will generate an &quot;Employee&quot; output which is then transformed into an &quot;Employee&quot; input for processes such as on-boarding, payroll etc.)

#### Generalisation

To conclude this phase, traditional inputs and outputs become generalised entities. To continue the Journal examples; Subscribers, Advertisers and Employees are abstracted to &quot;People&quot; while Articles and Adverts are abstracted to &quot;Content&quot;. These generic entities can then be deployed across multiple processes and ensure maximum integration and reuse between processes.

It&#39;s important to realise that while inputs and outputs are generalised, they can still contain different attributes depending on their role within the Architecture and the processes they interact with. The aim here is to achieve maximum reuse and integration while not restricting the efficacy of any individual process.

#### Independence

Loose coupling is key throughout IdealEA. While processes are designed to integrate to the maximum extent possible, they equally need to be modular, independent and replaceable. Repeated tasks are redefined as external sub-processes and shared among processes as needed.

## Phase 3 - Rationalisation

### Decomposition

Next an iterative approach is applied to each defined process in order to progress through various levels of granularity. Rather than completely decomposing individual processes, the focus here is to examine each process in tandem as viewed at a particular of granularity - facilitating the identification of repeatable steps at the highest level of abstraction.

Up to now the organisation has been viewed from a CEO&#39;s or Board of Directors&#39; perspective with high-level abstracted processes designed to fulfil the primary functions of the organisation. We now traverse down the organisation, examining each atrefact in more detail – again, with minimal engagement from SMEs.

### Sharing

As we progress through greater levels of artefact granularity, any generic items which can potentially be shared between larger artefacts are identified. Remember, inputs have already been abstracted to promote integration and so should not form a barrier to sharing of artefacts.

As an example, the Human Resources Department may use standard processes and datasets across a number of different recruitment functions, however, for particular recruitments, e.g. highly specialised or very senior roles, these standard processes and datasets may not be applicable in their most common form. Therefore, a decision needs to be made as to whether it is best to replicate large aspects of these artefacts or abstract the processes and datasets so that they can be applied globally – i.e. shared.

Each potentially shared artefact will be either:

- .Shared as-is
- .Abstracted to allow sharing across divergent parents
- .Replicated and developed independently (i.e. not shared)

In order to decide whether to share, abstract or replicate these artefacts, a number of factors should be considered:

- .Are changes required to the parent artefacts in order to consume the shared artefact
- .Can all parents survive on-going interdependence on the shared artefact
- .Are potential bottlenecks being caused by sharing a single entity across many parents
- .What is the relative frequency of occurrence for each potential parent
- .What degree of abstraction is required and does this outweigh the benefits of sharing

### Integration

At this point a complete set of generic, independent artefacts and their shared sub-artefacts has been created. Of particular interest are the shared artefacts as these, in addition to abstracted inputs and transformed inputs and outputs, will determine the most cost-effective integration points across the organisation.

## PHASE 4 – Derivation

We now have an Ideal Architecture particular to our organisation. However, in order to have the capacity to exist in any real-world environment, we now need to address Exceptions, Errors and Alternatives through our Derived Artefacts.

Each artefact is examined and Quality Pre-processes agreed to address Exceptions and Errors. Earlier efforts concerning shared artefacts should result in a limited number of distinct Quality Pre-processes being required as, wherever feasible, common components have been shared between artefacts.

As outlined earlier, Alternatives are added to completed artefacts where necessary. The intention is to maximise the reuse of the artefact across standard and alternative cases.

## Phase 5 – Baseline

Although listed as Phase 6 of IdealEA, the creation of the Baseline Architecture should be considered outside of scope for IdealEA and traditional EA frameworks and/or methodologies should be used here.

Ideally, a separate team or project is used to map the Baseline. While this can be performed in parallel to the earlier Phases of IdealEA, it is imperative that there is no cross-contamination of ideas between the two and, for this reason, Baseline is assumed to be take place once the Ideal Enterprise Architecture and Derived Artefacts have been created.

## PHASE 6 – Elimination

Artefacts within the Baseline Architecture which do not have an equivalent artefact within the Derived set should be examined in order to confirm whether a) these Orphaned Artefacts do not support the USP and POG of the organisation or business unit or b) the Existence and Mission phases were erroneous and have not properly identified the purpose, USP and POG of the organisation.

### Orphaned Artefacts

An Orphaned Artefact is one which does not exist in any form within the Ideal and Derived architectures and as a result should be considered redundant and eliminated as quickly and efficiently as possible.

### Incomplete Existence and Mission

Where a process is defined as Orphaned but cannot be eliminated from our Derived architecture, the results of both Existence and Mapping should be immediately reviewed as a fundamental function or business driver of the organisation has been overlooked.

## Phase 7 – Mapping

With a clear understanding of both the Derived Artefacts and Baseline Architecture the final phase, &quot;Mapping&quot;, examines the discrepancies between the two in order to attempt to gauge the extent to which each baseline artefact needs to change. In addition, the path between Baseline and Derived includes any impacts to both the USP and POG.

This is the first truly iterative phase in IdealEA, these mappings will change continuously as the organisation evolves towards the Derived architecture

### Living Document

Artefacts created in this phase are maintained under version control and expected to change frequently as a result of the Organisation&#39;s transition from Baseline towards Derived. As a result, artefacts from this Phase are expected to exist, to the greatest extent possible, independent of other artefacts so that the greatest variety of stakeholders can review and understand them.

### Quick wins

Mapping is concerned with the iterative application of &quot;quick-wins&quot;, rather than expensive and lengthy change programmes. This transitions the organisation from an environment of infrequent, large-scale transformation to that of a dynamic and reactive component of an ever-changing ecosystem

### Mapping Table

Thanks to Elimination, we should now have a clear correlation between each Baseline and one or more Derived artefacts, which are recorded in a tabular format, with the following headings:

- .BDP ID
- .Revision number
- .Baseline Artefact
- .Derived Artefact
- .Deviation
- .USP Impact
- .POG Impact
- .Synopsis
- .Action
- .Reference Artefacts

#### BDP ID

Each Baseline-Derived Pair (BDP) – one Baseline artefact mapped to a fully or partially equivalent Derived Artefact is recorded and given a unique identifier.

#### Revisions Number

As a particular BDP is updated to reflect implemented changes, the revision number is incremented. This allows the extent of change to be tracked for individual BDPs

#### Baseline Artefact and Derived Artefact

Short descriptions of both the Baseline and Derived artefacts are maintained, allowing the table to be reviewed and understood in isolation. As change is implemented and the revision number increased, the Baseline artefact is updated to reflect the new Baseline. Under normal conditions, the Derived artefact description should remain unchanged

#### Deviation

This is a summary of the extent to which the Baseline differs to the Derived and is recorded in non-technical language, allowing discussion and review by a wide range of stakeholders

#### USP Impact

Any impact on the USP of the organisation due to this deviation is outlined here. As the Baseline Artefact is revised, so too is the USP impact

#### POG Impact

Any POG affected by the deviation is listed here and updated as the Baseline changes.

#### Synopsis

Here we attempt to describe why the deviation exists, and the impact the deviation may have on our ability to achieve our Derived Artefact

#### Action

Any immediate or short term actions which could help to progress from Baseline to Derived are listed here. As actions are undertaken, updated versions of the artefact lists should be completed and circulated.

#### Reference Artefacts

Where needed, any referenced artefacts (i.e. underlying Baseline or Derived artefacts) are listed to allow for their inclusion in a review of the mapping table

## Conclusion

The Ideal Enterprise Architecture is an aspirational and ultimately unachievable architecture definition. By alleviating stakeholders of any responsibility to achieve Ideal, and assuring individual aspirations are included, agreement and buy-in are easily achieved. Rather than driving organizational change, Ideal is designed to validate and support incremental change while ensuring compliance with the fundamental functions and aims of the organization.
